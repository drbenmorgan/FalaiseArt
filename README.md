FalaiseArt
==========

Experimental implementation of [Falaise](https://github.com/supernemo-dbd/falaise) using
the [art](https://art.fnal.gov) framework for data management and processing.


Installing Art
==============

1. From Homebrew via the [art-suite tap](https://github.com/drbenmorgan/homebrew-art_suite)
2. From CVMFS (**TODO**)

Getting Started
===============

See [example_scripts](examples_scripts/README.md]) for a basic sanity check of the art installation
and working with FHiCL scripts for event/IO control.
